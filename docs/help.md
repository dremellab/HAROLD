## 🧩 Common Issues

**1. Missing or unreadable FASTQ files**
If HAROLD reports that input FASTQ files are missing or unreadable, double-check that the paths listed in your manifest file are correct and that you have read permissions. Paths can be absolute or relative to your working directory.

**2. Manifest format errors**
Ensure your manifest file is tab-separated and includes all required columns (`sampleName`, `groupName`, `batch`, `path_to_R1_fastq`, `path_to_R2_fastq`, and optionally `strandedness`). Duplicate sample names or incorrect headers will cause initialization to fail.

**3. Unsupported host or virus identifiers**
If HAROLD returns an error related to unsupported genomes, confirm that the host, additives, and viral accessions match the list of supported references. Refer to the [Inputs](inputs.md) page for the complete list.

**4. Pipeline fails after submission to SLURM**
Check the `logs/` subdirectory in your working directory. Each rule in Snakemake generates its own log file, which records errors and resource usage. You can also use `squeue -u $USER` to monitor job status.

**5. Configuration or environment errors**
If you see errors related to missing conda environments or software dependencies, verify that you have activated the correct environment using:

```bash
source /project/dremel_lab/scripts/.sh_common
mamba activate pipelines
```
