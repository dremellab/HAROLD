# ðŸ“Š HAROLD Outputs (Coming Soon)

This section will describe the files and directories generated by HAROLD upon successful completion of a run. It will include detailed explanations of result types, such as:

- **Count Matrices:** Raw and normalized count tables for host and viral genes.
- **QC Reports:** MultiQC summary reports combining results from various quality-control tools.
- **Alignment Files:** BAM and BAI files for read alignments, plus bigWig and junction bigBed files for visualization.
- **Configuration and Logs:** Metadata, logs, and configuration files saved for reproducibility.

Documentation for this page is under development and will be expanded soon to include file structure diagrams, naming conventions, and data interpretation guidance.
